1. What is Software? What is Software Engineering? 
Software is a set of Instructions given to computer to get desired results and proper functioning of computer system. Software Engineering is a study of  Computer system and computer programing languages, which teaches us "how does any computer works?", how any software is created and its proper functioning is maintained.

2. Explain types of Software.
There are 5 types of Software
(A) Application Software :
-Application software is a computer software package that performs a specific function for user.
-Application softwares are designed to carry out specific task other than one relating to the operation of computer.
-Examples: Powerpoint, Facebook, whatsapp, video editing apps etc.

(B) System Software :
-System softwares are designed to provide a platform for running computer hardware and other software applications.
-Operating systems like windows, linux and macOS are examples of of system software, because they manage the computer's resources and provide a user interface.
-System software coordinates the functions and activities of the hardware and software.

(C) Driver software :
- Driver software is a type of system software.
-Every device which is connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function.
-drivers are essential for ensuring that devices such as printers, graphics cards and network adapters work correctly with a computer system.
-Example: audio driver, video driver etc.

(D) Middle ware
-Middleware software is a type of software that acts as a bridge or intermediary between Application and system software or between two different application software.
-It is also used to mediate computers with different operating system.
-Example: database middleware, application server middleware

(E)Programming software
-programing software and programming tools enables develovers to devlop, write amd test other programs.
- Examples: complilers, interpreters etc.


(3)What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.
 -SDLC (Software development life cycle) is a process used by software development teams to design, devlop,test and deploy software.
-It helps to ensure that software projects are completed efficiently and meet the needs of user.
SDLC focus on the following phases of software development.

(A) Requirement Gathering
-users of software will give the complete description about "which type of software they need", "what functions should be included in the software"
-This phase define the project scope, objectives and requirementrs.

(B) Analysis
-In this phase requirements gathered are analyzed in detail to ensure they are clear, complete and consistent.
-this helps in ideentifiying any issues or conflicts.

(C) Designning
-Once the requirements are finalized the system blue prints are created.
-This phase involves designing the overall structure of system including database design, user interface design and system architecture.

(D)Implementation
 -In this phase developers start coding based on the design. They follow coding standards and protocols to write clean and efficient code.
-This phase involves collaboration between developers and may use various programming languages and tools.

(E)Testing
- Once the coding is completed, the software is tested to identify and fix any defects or bugs. This includes functional testing, perfomance testing and security testing.

(F) Maintenance
-system is monitored and updated as needed to address any issue, system is also updated to ensure security level.


(4) what is DFD? create a DFD diagram on flipcart.
- A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the flow of data.
-DFDs are commonly used to understand and document the flow of information within a system./

(5) What is Flow chart? create a flow chart of addition of 2 number.
-A Flowchart is a visual representation of a process using pre defined shapes connected by arrows to show the flow of steps.
- Flowchat is useful in many fields like software devlopment, engineering, business, education etc.

(6) what is use case diagram? Create a use case on bill payment on paytm. 
- A use case diagram is a graphical representation of "how users interact with a system or software application","how much information they can access" and " how many functions they can access".
